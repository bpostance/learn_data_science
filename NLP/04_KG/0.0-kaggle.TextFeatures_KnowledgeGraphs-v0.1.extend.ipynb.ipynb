    "## Basics of Knowledge Graphs using spaCy\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, I have explained the basics of building knowledge graphs using spaCy. \n",
    "First, lets understand what are knoweldge graphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What are knowlege graphs ? \n",
    "> Knowledge stored in a graph form. The knowledge is captured in entities, attributes, relationships. The Nodes represents entities, NodeLabels represents attributes, and Edges represents Relationships. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Example:  \n",
    "> Chris Nolan (Director, Producer, person) ---> born in  ----> London (place) ---> Director of  ----> Interstellar (Movie) ---> shooted in  -----> Iceland (place)  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Source of information for building knowledge graphs: \n",
    "> Structured Text: Wikipedia, Dbpedia  \n",
    "> Unstructured Text: Social Media, Blogs, Images, Videos, Audios \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Main ideas for building knowlege graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Entity Extraction   \n",
    "In this step, the aim is to extract right entities from the text data. spaCy provides NER (Named Entity Recognition) which can be used for this purpose.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Relationship Extraction    \n",
    "In this step, the aim is to identify the relationship between the sentences / entities. Again, by using spaCy one can extract the grammar relations between two words / entities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Relationship Linking    \n",
    "The hard part of knowlege graphs is to identify what kind of relationship exists between the two entities. The idea is to add the contextual sense to the relationship. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at very high level implementation of this idea using spacy. Lets load a news dataset. "
