    "***Pre-note** If you are an early stage or aspiring data analyst, data scientist, or just love working with numbers clustering is a fantastic topic to start with. In fact I actively steer my early career and junior data scientist toward this topic early on in their training and continued professional development cycle - sorry guys but its for your own good.*\n",

    "*Learning how to apply and perform accurate clustering analysis takes you though many of the core principles of data analysis, mathematics, machine learning, and computational science. From learning about data types and geometry, confusion matrix, to applying iterative aglorithms and efficient computation on big data. These foundational concepts crop up in most other areas of data science and machine learning. For instance, cluster distance matrices underpin and, mathematically, are near identical to graph data structures used in deep learning graph neural networks at the cutting edge of artificial intelligence research. So if you are just starting out then dont be put of and read on regardless of your level. We all have to start somewhere and this is a very good place!*\n",

    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster analysis is the task of grouping objects within a population in such a way that objects in the same group or cluster are more similar to one another than to those in other clusters. Clustering is a form of unsupervised learning as the number, size and distribution of clusters is unknown a priori.\n",
    "Clustering can be applied to a variety of different problems and domains including: customer segmentation for retail sales and marketing, identifying higher or lower risk groups within [insurance portfolios](https://www.casact.org/pubs/dpp/dpp08/08dpp170.pdf), to finding [storm systems on Jupyter](https://astronomycommunity.nature.com/users/253561-ingo-waldmann/posts/48323-deep-learning-saturn), and even identifying [galaxies far far away](https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.3097).\n",
    "\n",
    "Many real world datasets include combinations of numerical, ordinal (e.g. small, medium, large), and nomial (e.g. France, China, India) data features. However, many popular clustering algorithms and tutorials such as K-means are suitable for numerical data types only. This article is written on the assumption that these methods are familiar - but otherwise Sklearn provides an excellent review of these methods [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html#clustering) for a quick refresher. \n",
    "\n",
    "This article seeks to provide a review of methods and a practical application for clustering a dataset with mixed datatypes. You can find all of my code on [Github here](https://github.com/bpostance/training.data_science/blob/master/ML/2.3_Clustering/10-Clustering-Mixed-Data.ipynb)\n"

So while the actual algorithm impementations to achive this vary, in essence they are based on this simple principle of distance.This is illustrated quite nicely in illustration below that shows a data set with 3 clusters, and iterative cluster partitioning a-f by updating the centroid points (Chen 2018).

Computational efficiency is important here as each data feature introduces an additional dimension.For clustering, by definition, we often have a multiple features to make sense of and therefore the efficiency of the calculation in high dimensional space is crucial. \n",
    "\n",
    "***[Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance#Higher_dimensions)*** is the absolute numerical difference of their location in euclidean space. Distances can be 0 or take on any positive real number. It is given by the root sum-of-squares of differences between each pair (p,q) of points. And we can see that for high dimensions we simply add the distance. \n",

This illustrates how clustering results may be influenced by distance measures applied and depending on wether the data features are real and numeric or discrete ordinal and categorical values. In addition, perhaps this also illustrates to you how and why geometry and distance are important in other domains such as shortest path problems. \n",

Scipy has a covenient [pair distance](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-0.15.1/reference/generated/scipy.spatial.distance.pdist.html) ```pdist()``` function that applies many of the most common measures. \n",

As for mass KG in the car example above, this could still lead to a bias in the formation of clusters toward categorical feature groups as their distances are always either the min-max value of 0 or 1.\n",

    "Selecting the appropriate transformations and scaling to apply is part science and part art. There are often several strategies that may suit and must be applied and evalauted in relation to the context of challenge at hand, the data and its domain. Crucially, whatever strategy is adopted,  **all features** in the final dataset that is used for clustering data must be on the same scale for each eature to be treated equally by the distance metrics. \n",

The difference between Gold-Bronze (= 3-1 = 2) is greater than between Gold and Silver (= 3-2 = 1) worse. Clearly this is ordinal as each category has a rank and relative scale comapred to each other category.\n",

    ">**NOTE**: Distance measures and encoding is perhaps THE hardest part to clustering data. In this authors opinion, especially for categorical and ordinal features, data should be treated with caution and practitioners should trial and evaluate different feature engineering and encdoing strategies based on their understanding of the data and its domain. My other recommendation is to trial and test different strategies first with smaller datasets and those where you have a reasonable understanding of what the clusters SHOULD be (Iris, Titanic). Valid your approach on these data, and then apply to you own data and build up the complexity from there deciding where to put more focus on tuning the encoding process.

I think that we are hitting the [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality), as the CLARANS implementaiton in pyclustering uses a euclidean distance metric. Euclidean distance breaks down in high dimensional space (see [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-cluster-in-high-dimensions-4ef693bacc6) and [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clustering_high-dimensional_data).
